# Gradle Android Quality Plugin

A simple plugin to apply and configure some popular quality tools in Android Gradle Projects.

## The Plan

1. Add to a project. `apply plugin: 'android-quality'`
2. Run checks.`$ gradle check` `$ gradle checkDebug`
3. ???
4. Profit!

## TODO

Pretty much all of it.

1. Plugin to apply other plugins
2. Assorted config files that don't flag normal Android stuff.
